Project Scope: Governance & Creative Tooling for Nouns DAO Africa

Overview

Nouns DAO Africa (NDA) is building the infrastructure to support an open, transparent, and community-driven governance system that empowers African creators and DAO participants. To achieve this, we are launching three interconnected initiatives:
	1.	Snapshot Integration — to enable off-chain signaling governance with on-chain execution through SafeSnap.
	2.	Fork of Gnars DAO Terminal for NDA Front End — to provide a branded, user-friendly interface where the NDA community can view auctions, proposals, and treasury data.
	3.	Custom Fork of Noundry Studio — to empower African artists and builders to collaboratively design, experiment, and mint creative assets that feed directly into the DAO ecosystem.

Together, these deliverables will provide Nouns DAO Africa with the governance, transparency, and creative tooling it needs to thrive as a decentralized community and position itself as a leader within the broader Nouns ecosystem.

Objectives

1. Snapshot Integration
	•	Establish a dedicated Snapshot space for Nouns DAO Africa.
	•	Configure and deploy the SafeSnap module, which connects Snapshot votes to NDA’s Gnosis Safe treasury.
	•	Implement governance workflows where proposals can be created, voted on by token holders, and executed automatically if they pass quorum.
	•	Test and document execution flows to ensure secure and transparent proposal lifecycles.
	•	Provide an accessible front-end governance portal so community members can easily participate in decision-making without high gas costs.

Rationale:
Snapshot lowers the barrier to participation by enabling gasless voting, while SafeSnap ensures that votes can trigger binding on-chain actions. This combination ensures legitimacy, transparency, and inclusivity in NDA’s governance processes.

2. Fork of Gnars DAO Terminal for NDA Front End
	•	Fork the Gnars DAO Terminal codebase to serve as the dedicated front end for NDA.
	•	Apply custom branding and design elements, including NDA logo, color palettes, typography, and community messaging.
	•	Integrate NDA-specific auction and governance data, including live treasury balance, active auctions, and proposal history.
	•	Configure cross-DAO compatibility, ensuring that NDA’s front end can interoperate with Lil Nouns, Nouns, and other Build Africa DAO initiatives.
	•	Ensure modularity so that the Terminal can expand to support additional DAOs under the Build Africa DAOs (BAD) umbrella.

Rationale:
Gnars Terminal is a proven interface that makes DAO activity transparent and accessible. By forking and customizing it, NDA gains a public-facing hub where both members and outside observers can track governance, treasury activity, and auction outcomes.

3. Custom Fork of Noundry Studio
	•	Deploy a dedicated fork of Noundry Studio, customized for African creativity and cultural narratives.
	•	Integrate Africa-focused templates, trait libraries, and generative art pipelines to support unique NFT collection development.
	•	Provide a minting pipeline for artists and creators to experiment with and deploy new collections tied to DAO governance or community events.
	•	Enable community submissions of creative proposals, allowing artists to submit new designs directly into governance workflows.
	•	Develop documentation and onboarding guides for artists, ensuring accessibility for both technical and non-technical contributors.
	•	Pilot with an initial set of community-led creative campaigns to demonstrate real-world use cases.

Rationale:
Noundry Studio is an innovation engine for Nouns-style generative art. By customizing it for African contexts, NDA creates a culturally resonant creative platform where local artists can participate meaningfully in DAO building, NFT collection design, and governance.

Timeline

Phase 1 — Governance Integration (Weeks 1–3)
	•	Launch Snapshot space.
	•	Configure SafeSnap and test proposal execution.
	•	Publish governance documentation.

Phase 2 — NDA Terminal Deployment (Weeks 3–6)
	•	Fork Gnars Terminal repo.
	•	Apply branding and integrate NDA smart contracts.
	•	Deploy production NDA Terminal.

Phase 3 — Noundry Studio Fork (Weeks 6–10)
	•	Fork Noundry Studio and customize creative pipeline.
	•	Integrate Africa-focused templates and traits.
	•	Test minting and proposal submission workflows.
	•	Deploy to production and onboard artists.

⸻

Success Metrics
	•	Governance Participation: 30% of token holders voting on Snapshot proposals in first 3 months.
	•	Transparency: Live NDA Terminal with active treasury and auction data displayed to the public.
	•	Creative Engagement: 20+ submissions through the Noundry Studio fork in the first quarter of launch.
	•	Community Onboarding: 50+ artists or builders using NDA tooling by end of Year 1.

⸻

Dependencies
	•	Snapshot and SafeSnap infrastructure.
	•	Gnosis Safe for treasury management.
	•	Open-source repos from Gnars DAO Terminal and Noundry Studio.
	•	Active participation from NDA core team for branding, testing, and onboarding.
	•	Community support for pilot governance proposals and creative submissions.

⸻

Risks & Mitigation
	•	Technical Debt: Forks may drift from upstream repos → establish update/merge strategy.
	•	Low Participation: Governance tools unused if community isn’t onboarded → invest in education and communication campaigns.
	•	Cultural Misalignment: Creative tooling must reflect African contexts → engage local artists early to shape libraries and traits.
